# Burpsuite-LLM-Extension
In a collaborative project, We developed an extension for Burp Suite using Python, Flask, LangChain, and the Gemini LLM. This extension was designed to monitor and alert users about vulnerabilities in request/response instances by analyzing request headers and body content, ensuring precise safety evaluations and enhancing the overall security assessment process.
